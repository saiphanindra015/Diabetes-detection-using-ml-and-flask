1. **Objective**: Develop a web application that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on health metrics using machine learning.
2. **Dataset**: Utilize the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes features like glucose level, BMI, age, and insulin.
3. **Modeling**: Train models such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest for binary classification (diabetic or not).
4. **Web App**: Build a user-friendly interface with Flask where users input data and receive instant predictions.
5. **Deployment**: Host the application locally or on platforms like Heroku, demonstrating end-to-end ML deployment skills.
